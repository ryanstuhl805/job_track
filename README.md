# Job Tracker API
Full disclosure, this wasn't ever intended to be a production ready API app. It is purely for my own practice and education. 

It is coupled with a React front-end (separate repo) which I can perform CRUD actions from. I wanted to sharpen my skills around coupling a separate API-only backend with a stand alone front-end.

Interested in using it for yourself? Fork the repo and make your own modifications. I won't merge in outside pull requests for now. I'm just using it for my own experience.
